##Introduction

This dojo is going to be more fragmented than the first 'minesweeper' one. There are three small coding problems that we'd like you to solve in two different ways, with a little 'extra-credit' at the end for the really keen.

We're open for you to use any language in solving these problems - with a view to discussing pros and cons for each at the end. And the ways in which you solve them is up to you. If you're stuck for a second way, try thinking of a constraint (such as 'now solve it without any loops') and how you would go about recoding your solution while meeting that constraint.

##The Problems:

1. **Write a palindrome tester.**

   Given a string (such as "Amore, Roma"), return a boolean stating whether this is a valid palindrome.
   
2. **Parentheses evaluator**

   Given a string, test whether it has fully balancing parentheses (of a mixed type - eg "hello, (these [are some]) {parentheses}")
   
3. **Factorial calculator**
  
   Return the factorial of a number. For example, 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24

###Extra credit:
Benchmark your solutions. How do they perform? Is there a way you could make any of your solutions faster?

### Immediate todo list

- [x] Draft readme
- [ ] Write test suites for dynamically typed language
- [ ] Write test suites for statically typed language
- [ ] Test the test suites
- [ ] ??? do we provide benchmarking tools, or should that be left as a task for the participant?
